<h2>What's my name?</h2>
<p>Welcome! I'm Nicholas Pretli (you can call me Nicholas or Nick, though most call me Nick).</p> 
<h2>Educational Background</h2>
<p>McMaster University (BSc), 2020</p>
<p>I'm a recent graduate of McMaster University with a background in Geography, Environmental Studies/Science, and some additional courses in Psychology. </p>
<h2>What I'm Up To Now</h2>
<p>I decided to enroll in the Geographic Information Systems Cartographic Specialist program at Fleming College in an effort to strengthen my technical skills, and to couple these technical skills with the more theoretical background that I obtained at university. I attended Fleming College's open house in March 2020 without knowing much about the school or the program at the time, but I left with a great impression of the Frost Campus and its reputation for GIS. After that point, I knew Fleming was for me.</p>
<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p>Over the last 8 years across high school and university, I've worked various jobs as a lift operator, general labourer, office assistant, research assistant, and at a bakery.</p>
<h2>Where Am I From?</h2>
<p>I'm from a small harbourfront community in Grey County, Ontario called Meaford. The joke of the town is that the population has remained relatively steady for the past 30 years, capping at around 4,500 for the town (~11,000 for the municipality). The town is within a half hour's drive from the communities of Owen Sound, Collingwood, and the popular Blue Mountain ski resort (I'm not much of a skiier)</p>
<p>During most of my time at university, I lived in the Westdale neighbourhood of Hamilton, Ontario.

<h2>Fun Facts About Me...</h2> 
<p>I consider myself a bit of a music geek: I play a couple instruments (mostly guitar and piano these days), and I played the cello in elementary and high school. I've also tried out several other instruments (drums, trombone, and the alto saxophone).</p>
<p>I learned how to drive a car with a manual transmission when I was 16 years old. It was a great struggle at first, but now I'm a devout enthusiast. Learning was 100% worth it, and auto-only drivers are 100% missing out on a lot of fun; it's the way to drive.</p>
<p>My family has two cats (14/male & 9/male) named Simon and Piper, respectively. My parents got the first one by chance through someone at work who had given the cat to a family member as a gift, but couldn't care for it (sad, I know), so we're happy that he ended up with us! The second one was a stray and showed up at my parents' doorstep in 2011. He wouldn't leave, and he hasn't left us since!

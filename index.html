<h1>Nicholas (Nick) Pretli's Homepage</h1>
<div>
<h2>Greetings!</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Nicholas Pretli. Most people call me Nick. Welcome!</p> 
<h2>Educational Background</h2>
<p> I'm a recent graduate of McMaster University (Class of 2020). My academic background is fairly eclectic; my major was a combined Geography & Environmental Science, and I took a number of Psychology courses in my undergrad from which I obtained a minor. </p>
<h2>What I'm Up to Now</h2>
<p>I decided to enroll in the Geographic Information Systems Cartographic Specialist program at Fleming College in an effort to strengthen my technical skills, and to couple these technical skills with the more theoretical background that I obtained at university.</p>
<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p>Over the last eight years across high school and university, I've worked at a number of jobs: I've been a lift operator, general labourer, office assistant, research assistant, and I've worked at a bakery.</p>
<h2>Where I'm From</h2>
<p>I'm from a small harbourfront community in Grey County, Ontario called Meaford. The population has remained fairly steady for the past 30 years at about 4,500. The town is within a half hour's drive from the communities of Owen Sound, Collingwood, and the popular Blue Mountain ski resort (I'm not much of a skiier). From Toronto, Meaford is about 2 1/2 hours' drive.</p>

<h4>During most of my time as an undergraduate, I lived in the Westdale neighbourhood of Hamilton, Ontario near McMaster University.</h4> <img src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=Westdale,Ontario&zoom=14&size=600x300&maptype=hybrid&key=AIzaSyDkNXlV6Rib05Pi-6McS2M8uChUQGBN9xo" alt="Trulli" width="600" height="300">
<h2>Some Fun Facts</h2> 
<p>I consider myself a die-hard music lover. Cool bands, concerts, instruments, music trivia, radio shows, you name it. Music is awesome.</p>
<p>I eat a meat-free diet, and have been doing so for a little over 10 years.</p>
<p>I've never been on a plane before.</p>
<p>I have one sibling.</p>
<p>I bake homemade bread in a breadmaker regularly.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy biking, and I was a member of the mountain biking team in high school.</p>
<p>I raise monarchs (monarch caterpillars) on occasion and see them become butterflies. I feel happy knowing that I'm helping the monarch population out a little whenver I do this.</p>
<p>I can drive a manual transmission (the first car I ever drove had one)</p>
<p>I've enjoyed looking at maps since primary school. I would scrutinize them on long road trips with my family. My favourite map was the roadmap of Ontario by MapArt Publishing. It had the best colours!</p>
<h2>Where Do You See Yourself In Five Years?</h2>
<p>To be honest, I'm not entirely sure (but who else really knows). I'd love to be in a career that involves working with maps at some capacity. This prospect is probably the main impetus for my decision to continue my studies at Fleming.</p>

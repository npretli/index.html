<h1>Nicholas ("Nick") Pretli</h1>
<div>
<h2>What's My Alias?</h2>
<p>Most people call me Nick. On paper it tends to be Nicholas. Either works!</p> 
<h2>Educational Background</h2>
<p> I'm a recent graduate of McMaster University (Class of 2020). My academic background is fairly eclectic; my major was a combined Geography & Environmental Science, and I took a number of Psychology courses in my undergrad from which I obtained a minor. </p>
<h2>What I'm Up to Now</h2>
<p>I decided to enroll in the Geographic Information Systems Cartographic Specialist program at Fleming College in an effort to strengthen my technical skills, and to couple these technical skills with the more theoretical background that I obtained at university.</p>
<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p>Over the last eight years across high school and university, I've worked at a number of jobs: I've been a lift operator, general labourer, office assistant, research assistant, and I've worked at a bakery.</p>
<h2>Where I am From</h2>
<p>I'm from a small harbourfront community in Grey County, Ontario called Meaford. The population has remained fairly steady for the past 30 years at about 4,500. The town is within a half hour's drive from the communities of Owen Sound, Collingwood, and the popular Blue Mountain ski resort (I'm not much of a skiier). From Toronto, Meaford is about 2 1/2 hours' drive.</p>

<h4>During most of my time as an undergraduate, I lived in the Westdale neighbourhood of Hamilton, Ontario near McMaster University.</h4> <img src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=Westdale,Ontario&zoom=14&size=600x300&maptype=hybrid&key=AIzaSyDkNXlV6Rib05Pi-6McS2M8uChUQGBN9xo" alt="Trulli" width="600" height="300">
<h2>Fun Facts About Me</h2> 
<p>I consider myself a die-hard music lover, and I can remember loving it from a young age. Bands, artists, concerts, instruments, music trivia, radio shows, you name it. Music is awesome.</p>
<p>I eat a meat-free diet, and have been doing so for about 10 years.</p>
<p>I've never been on a plane before.</p>
<p>I've been baking bread in a breadmaker off and on since I was about 10 - 12 years old or so. I've memorized a couple favourite recipes, which makes it a lot easier!</p>
<p>I can drive a manual transmission and love doing so (the first car I ever drove happened to have one). I have a tendency to spread my enthusiasm for it to those around me.</p>
<p>I can remember loving to look at maps since I was in primary school. On long trips to visit my grandparents in extreme southwestern Ontario, I would be eager to look at the map and ask my parents where we were. As a child, I remember my favourite map being a roadmap of Ontario by MapArt Publishing - its design was just the best!</p>
<h2>Where Do You See Yourself In Five Years?</h2>
<p>To be honest, I'm not entirely sure (but who else knows). I'd love to be in a career that involves working with maps at some capacity. This prospect is probably the main impetus for my decision to continue my studies at Fleming.</p>

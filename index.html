<p>This is a personal webpage for Nick Pretli. I'm a recent graduate of McMaster University (Geography & Environmental Science), and I'm from a harbourfront town in Grey County, Ontario. In an effort to strengthen my practical and technical skills, I decided to enroll in the PGCert, Geographic Information Systems - Cartographic Specialist program for the 2020/2021 year.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm a student with a background in Environmental Studies, Environmental Science, Geography and some Psychology. I'm from a small harbourfront community in Grey County, Ontario, Canada. I love playing & listening to music, and I love cars, bikes, animals and nature.</p>

<h3>Education</h3> 
<p>McMaster University (BSc), 2020</p>
<p>Fleming College (PGCert), expected graduation in 2021</p>

<h4>What I'm Up To</h4>
<p>In an attempt to strengthen my practical and technical skills, I decided to enroll in the PGCert, Geographic Information Systems - Cartographic Specialist program at Fleming College for the 2020/2021 school year. I attended Fleming College's open house in March 2020 without knowing much about the school or the program at the time, but I left with a great impression of the Frost Campus and of its reputation for GIS.</p>

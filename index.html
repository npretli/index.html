<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm a student with a background in Environmental Studies, Environmental Science, Geography and some Psychology. I'm from a small harbourfront community in Grey County, Ontario, Canada. I love playing & listening to music, and I love cars, bikes, animals and nature.</p>
<br> 
<h3>Education</h3> 
<p>McMaster University (BSc), 2020</p>
<p>Fleming College (PGCert), expected graduation in 2021</p>
<br>
<h3>What I'm Up To</h3>
<p>With a goal of strengthening my practical and technical skills, I decided to enroll in the Geographic Information Systems Cartographic Specialist program at Fleming College for the 2020/2021 school year. I attended Fleming College's open house in March 2020 without knowing much about the school or the program at the time, but I left with a great impression of the Frost Campus and of its reputation for GIS.</p>

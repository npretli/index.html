<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hey, I'm Nicholas Pretli. When it comes to the "Nicholas" or "Nick" debate, honestly you do you! Most people I know call me Nick, though I get Nicholas a lot, too - especially for more formal matters or in writing.</p> 
<p>I'm a recent graduate of McMaster University with a background in Environmental Studies, Environmental Science, Geography and some courses in Psychology. I'm from a small harbourfront community in Grey County, Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>I consider myself a bit of a music geek - I play a couple instruments (guitar, piano, cello) though I've dabbled on a number of others. I also like cars, bikes, animals and heading out into nature. Recently, and like many others this year, I've embarked on some additional cooking and baking at home which led to a personal binder full of recipes for me to carry through life. I try to keep a good book on hand, whether fiction or non-fiction (though I'm conviced I prefer non-fiction; not sure why).</p>
<br> 
<h2>Education</h2> 
<p>McMaster University (BSc), 2020</p>
<p>Fleming College (PGCert), expected graduation in 2021</p>
<br>
<h2>What I'm Up To</h2>
<p>With a goal of strengthening my practical and technical skills, I decided to enroll in the Geographic Information Systems Cartographic Specialist program at Fleming College for the 2020/2021 school year. I attended Fleming College's open house in March 2020 without knowing much about the school or the program at the time, but I left with a great impression of the Frost Campus and its reputation for GIS.</p>
